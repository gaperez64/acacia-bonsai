# Acacia bonsai

This is a minimal implementation of universal co-Buchi reactive synthesis
algorithms using antichain data structures.

# TODO
* add tests for the remove operation in red-black trees
* code proper insertion in antichains using nested red-black trees (involves
  search and recursive removal of dominated elements in split-based fashion)
