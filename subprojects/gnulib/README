To update gnulib, we follow a process similar to the glib:
  https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/blob/master/glib/gnulib/README

That is:
- Create an empty directory, and an empty configure.ac
- Run gnulib-tool --import argp argmatch progname closeout
- Copy the files in lib/ back to that directory.

No modifications have been made to these files in this repository.

To create config.h.meson, we s/#undef/#mesondefine/ the config.h.in, as
suggested by meson/ac_converter.py.  The meson.build file was mostly generated
by that tool, with some tweaks (that are probably slightly wrong).
