  abstract = {We present Spot 2.0, a C++ library with Python bindings
		  and an assortment of command-line tools designed to
		  manipulate LTL and $\omega$-automata in batch. New
		  automata-manipulation tools were introduced in Spot 2.0;
		  they support arbitrary acceptance conditions, as
		  expressible in the Hanoi Omega Automaton format. Besides
		  being useful to researchers who have automata to process,
		  its Python bindings can also be used in interactive
		  environments to teach $\omega$-automata and model checking.},
